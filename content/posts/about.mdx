I am a mathematics student at the Technical University of Munich with a fascination for simplicity hidden behind complexity. This website is a scattered collection of personal thoughts and ideas as well as topic summaries. My main objective in writing this blog is to better my understanding of topics by wording them out with a scrutiny that may hold up to another reader such as yourself. I hope you find something interesting here. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me on [X](https://x.com/aschenbachlucas).
